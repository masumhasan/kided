## üöÄ Getting Started

This project can be run locally for development or built for production deployment.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
- A package manager like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- A **Google Gemini API Key**.

### Local Development Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/masumhasan/eduplay.git
    cd eduplay
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    For a robust development and build process, we'll use Vite. If a `package.json` file is not present, create one and install the required packages.

    ```bash
    # Create a package.json file if it doesn't exist
    npm init -y

    # Install dependencies
    npm install react react-dom @google/genai firebase livekit-client

    # Install development dependencies
    npm install --save-dev typescript vite @vitejs/plugin-react @types/react @types/react-dom
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add your Gemini API Key. This file should not be committed to version control.

    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

4.  **Configure Vite:**
    Create a file named `vite.config.ts` in the project root. This configuration will load your API key from the `.env.local` file and make it available as `process.env.API_KEY`, ensuring no code changes are needed in the app.

    ```typescript
    import { defineConfig, loadEnv } from "vite";
    import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

    // https://vitejs.dev/config/
    export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => {
      const env = loadEnv(mode, process.cwd(), "");
      return {
        plugins: [react()],
        define: {
          "process.env.API_KEY": JSON.stringify(env.GEMINI_API_KEY),
        },
      };
    });
    ```

5.  **Run the Development Server:**
    Add the following scripts to your `package.json`:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "dev": "vite",
      "build": "vite build",
      "preview": "vite preview"
    }
    ```
    Now, start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Vite (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

### Deploying with Netlify (Optional)

You can also deploy your app using Netlify for fast, global hosting.

---

### 1. **Install Netlify CLI**

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

Verify:

```bash
netlify --version
```

---

### 2. **Login**

```bash
netlify login
```

This will open your browser to authenticate with your Netlify account.

---

### 3. **Initialize a Project**

Inside your project folder:

```bash
netlify init
```

- Connects your local project to a Netlify site.
- You can either create a new site or link an existing one.

---

### 4. **Check Status**

```bash
netlify status
```

- Shows which Netlify site the current folder is linked to.
- Displays account, team, and site details.

---

### 5. **Deploy**

There are two main deploy types:

#### a) **Draft/Preview Deploy (not live)**

```bash
netlify deploy
```

- Builds your site and deploys it to a **unique preview URL**.
- Use this for testing before going live.

#### b) **Production Deploy (live)**

```bash
netlify deploy --prod
```

- Deploys your site to the **main site URL**.

---

### 6. **Optional Flags**

- `--dir=dist` ‚Üí specify build output directory
- `--message "update homepage"` ‚Üí add a deploy message
- `--prod` ‚Üí push to production

Example:

```bash
netlify deploy --dir=build --prod --message "Added login feature"
```

---

‚ö° Quick Flow:

```bash
netlify login
netlify init
netlify status
netlify deploy --prod
```

---

---

## üèóÔ∏è Building and Deploying

To create a production-ready version of KidEd, you'll bundle the application into static files.

### Step 1: Build the Application

Run the build command from your project's root directory.

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will create a `dist` folder containing the optimized static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for your application.

### Step 2: Deploy to a Hosting Provider

You can deploy the contents of the `dist` folder to any static web hosting service.

#### Option A: Deploying to Firebase Hosting

1.  **Install Firebase CLI:** If you don't have it, install it globally.

    ```bash
    npm install -g firebase-tools
    ```

2.  **Login and Initialize Hosting:**

    ```bash
    firebase login
    firebase init hosting
    ```

    - Follow the prompts. When asked, select your existing Firebase project (`eduplay-471808`).
    - Set your public directory to **`dist`**.
    - Configure as a single-page app by answering **Yes** to `Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)?`.

3.  **Deploy:**
    After building your app, run the deploy command:

    ```bash
    firebase deploy --only hosting
    ```

    Your application will be live at your Firebase project's URL.

4.  **(Optional) Custom Domain:**
    If you connect a custom domain to Firebase Hosting, you **must** add it to the list of authorized domains in Firebase Authentication settings to allow Google Sign-In to work.

#### Option B: Deploying to Vercel or Netlify

1.  Push your project code to a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository.
2.  Sign up on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and connect your Git account.
3.  Import your project repository.
4.  Configure the build settings:
    - **Framework Preset:** Vite
    - **Build Command:** `npm run build`
    - **Output Directory:** `dist`
5.  Add your Gemini API Key (`GEMINI_API_KEY`) as an environment variable in the project settings on the hosting platform.
6.  Click **Deploy**. Vercel/Netlify will provide you with a URL for your deployed app (e.g., `your-app.vercel.app`).

7.  **Authorize the Domain in Firebase:**
    For Google Sign-In to work, you must add your new Vercel/Netlify URL to the list of authorized domains in Firebase:
    - Go to your [Firebase project's Authentication settings](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/eduplay-471808/authentication/settings).
    - Under the **Settings** tab, go to the **Authorized domains** section.
    - Click **Add domain** and enter your deployment URL (e.g., `your-app.vercel.app`).
